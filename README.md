# CV Boilerplate

A boilerplate to ease the pain of building and maintaining a CV or résumé using LaTeX.

## Intro

The separation of content from presentation is considered a universal best practice. The typical content of a CV is a perfect fit for a YAML file due to its structured nature:

```YAML
---
name: Friedrich Nietzsche
address:
- Humboldtstraße 36
- 99425 Weimar
- Prussia
email: friedrich@thevoid.de
# ...
experience:
- years: 1879--1889
  employer: Freiberufler
  job: Freier Philosoph
  city: Sils-Maria
- years: 1869–-1879
  employer: Universität Basel
  job: Professor für klassische Philologie
  city: Basel
```

That makes super easy to update a CV while keeping a consistent structure.

Thanks to [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), we can then access our data from `template.tex` using a special notation. Iterating on repetitive data structures becomes trivial:

```latex
$for(experience)$
  $experience.years$\\
  \textsc{$experience.employer$}\\
  \emph{$experience.job$}\\
  $experience.city$\\[.2cm]
$endfor$
```

LaTeX takes then care of the typesetting with its usual elegance. Below a preview of the final result. Check out the [output](output.pdf) to see the compiled PDF.

With this method, you can keep your entire CV encoded in a single YAML file, put it under version control (into a gist, for instance), and generate a PDF on the fly when needed. You can also easily export it to other formats, like HTML for web publishing (I've heard [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) likes YAML). Convenient, portable and time-proof.

## Dependencies

1. LaTeX with the following extra packages: `fontspec` `geometry` `multicol` `xunicode` `xltxtra` `marginnote` `sectsty` `ulem` `hyperref` `polyglossia`
2. [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), the universal document converter.

I highly recommend [TinyTeX](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) as LaTeX distribution. All additional packages can be installed with `tlmgr` as needed.

## Getting started

1. Fill `details.yml` with your personal details, work experience, education, and desired settings.
2. Run `make docker` to build the docker image.
2. Run `make` to compile the PDF with a temporary docker container.
3. Tweak on `template.tex` until you're satisfied with the result.

**Note**: this template needs to be compiled with XeTeX.

### Note for Windows users

Although I didn't test it, you can probably use this on Windows, too. Both [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/installing.html) and LaTeX can be installed on Windows and you should be able to run makefiles on Windows through [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/). If that's too much hassle, this command should do the trick in Powershell:

    pandoc details.yml -o output.pdf --template=template.tex --pdf-engine=xelatex

## Available settings

- **`mainfont`**: Crimson Text is the default, but every font from the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) collection should work with the Docker image.
- **`fontsize`**: Possible values here are 10pt, 11pt and 12pt.
- **`lang`**: Sets the main language through the `polyglossia` package. This is important for proper hyphenation, among other things.
- **`geometry`**: A string that sets the margins through `geometry`. Read [this](https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Page_size_and_margins) to learn how this package works.
